**Contributing to IShowSpeed**
Thank you for being a part of IShowSpeeds community.
Since it is open sourced, here are some tips of getting started.

**Setting up to contribute**
I. Before contributing, fork the repository first (click the <bkd>fork</bkd> of [the page](https://github.com/mwang840/IShowSpeed))

II. Clone your fork locally
    ***Git Bash***
    # in a terminal, cd to parent directory where you want your clone to be, then
    git clone https://github.com/<your_github_username>/IShowSpeed.git, then cd into IShowSpeed

    # making any changes, checkout a seperate branch ('''git checkout branchname''') then once staging your changes, merge it into the "dev" branch
III. Make sure to install the dependencies (npm i is you are using npm or yarn add if you are using yarn)
